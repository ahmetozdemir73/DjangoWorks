# DjangoProjects

This repository was created to gather the Django projects I developed while learning and experimenting with the framework. The repository contains a variety of Django projects with different features, which can provide ideas on how to create web applications with Django. Moreover, by examining the code of the projects, it is possible to learn about various structures and techniques used in Django. 

(New projects will be added to this repository in a short period of time. I am constantly working on developing new projects using Django and will be sharing them in this repository as soon as they are ready. Stay tuned for more updates!)
